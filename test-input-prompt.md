I need to plan out my entire product launch for next quarter. First, create a task to conduct market research and competitor analysis in the Research column - I need to understand our positioning before we move forward. Then add a task to design the product mockups and wireframes in the Design column, making sure we have all the user flows mapped out properly.

Next, I want to schedule a task for developing the MVP backend API in the Development column - this should include user authentication, data models, and the core functionality we discussed. Also add another development task for building the frontend React components in the same Development column.

For marketing, create a task to write the product announcement blog post in the Marketing column, and another one to design social media graphics and promotional materials. I also need a task to reach out to potential beta testers and influencers in the Outreach column.

Finally, add a task to prepare the product demo presentation in the Presentation column, and create one more task to set up analytics and tracking systems in the Analytics column. Oh, and don't forget to add a task for planning the launch event logistics in the Events column - we'll need to book a venue and send invitations.

This launch needs to be comprehensive, so make sure each task has enough detail that the team knows exactly what needs to be done.*
